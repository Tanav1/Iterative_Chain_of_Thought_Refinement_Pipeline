            " Reason step by step. The problem states that there were 5,000 students, each eating 1/4 of a pie. Since the total number of students is 5,000, and each student eats 1/4 of a pie, then the total number of pies is 5,000 x 1/4 = 1,250. Each pie is 11 inches in diameter. The area of each pie is \u03c0(11)^2 = 121\u03c0 square inches. The total number of square inches of pizza consumed is 1,250 x 121\u03c0 = 151,250\u03c0. To find the numerical value of the answer, we need to use the value of \u03c0 = 3.14. 151,250\u03c0 = 151,250 x 3.14 = 475,375. The answer is 475\n",

Subsidies can make solar panels more affordable, which can increase the number of people who install them.\\n\\n## Step 3: Reason the effect of no subsidies\\nWithout subsidies, the cost of installing solar panels would likely increase, making them less affordable for some people. This could lead to a decrease in the number of people who install solar panels.\\n\\n## Step 4: Quantify the effect\\nHowever, the question doesn't provide specific data on the number of people who would install solar panels without subsidies.

The average walking speed of an ant is 1.5 millimeters per second. The average walking speed of a human is 1 meter per second. To find out how many times as fast as ants humans are, we need to divide the average walking speed of a human by the average walking speed of an ant. This will give us a ratio of how many times faster humans are than ants.\\nStep 1: Identify the average walking speeds of ants and humans.\\nAnts: 1.5 millimeters per second\\nHumans: 1 meter per second\\nStep 2: Convert the average walking speed of humans from meters per second to millimeters per second.\\n1 meter = 1000 millimeters\\nSo, 1 meter per second = 1000 millimeters per second\\nStep 3: Divide the average walking speed of humans by the average walking speed of ants.\\nHumans\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"final_reasoning\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 96,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Question: How many fewer people would have solar panels if there were no subsidies for installing it?\\n Reason step by step. \\nThe question is asking us to determine how many fewer people would install solar panels if there were no subsidies.

It implies that the player is standing with their studs facing upwards, which is a defensive stance that can be used to protect oneself from an opponent's attack.\\n\\n## Step 3: Analyze the plausibility of the sentence\\nConsidering the context of the FA Cup and the meaning of \\\"went in studs up\\\", the sentence is plausible because it is possible for a player to go into a\",\n          \"Q: How many times as fast as ants are humans?\\n- Step 2 is invalid: \\\"Step 2: Find the speed of humans.
